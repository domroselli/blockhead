# Purpose

Blockhead is meant to be an interactive way to learn about blockchain technology. It is not designed to be a full blown, real deal blockchain, but
instead to allow users to interact with a toy blockchain and understand the basic concepts.

Blockhead acts as a standalone node where all of the typically blockchain processes are ran. There will be a built-in web UI where users
can add transactions, trigger mining, edit transactions etc in order to see, step-by-step, how a blockchain works.

Blockhead started as an attempt at re-implementing the simple chain shown [here](https://blockchain.works-hub.com/blog/Learn-Blockchains-by-Building-One) but has 
since evolved into (hopefully) a learning tool.


# Typical process

* Start the app :)
* Open up a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/`. From there just follow the arrows in the top menu
